<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
In almost every field of science, it is now possible to capture large amounts of data. This has led machine learning to play an increasingly important role in scientific discovery, for example sifting through large amounts of data to identify interesting events. But modern machine learning techniques are less well suited for the critical tasks of devising hypotheses  consistent  with  the  data  or 
imagining new experiments to test those hypotheses. 
</p>

<p>
The goal of our project is to develop new learning techniques that can help automate this process of generating 
scientific theories from data. In particular, we are working to develop techniques that easily incorporate prior knowledge about the phenomena we want to model, and that produce interpretable models that can be analyzed to devise new experiments or to infer causal relations. We believe these techniques have
the potential to revolutionize the way scientists in a variety of fields interact with data. More broadly, our proposed techniques will be useful in any setting that requires learning more interpretable models with strong requirements on their desired behavior. 
</p>

<p>
Our approach is based on the observation that programming languages provide a uniquely expressive formalism to describe complex models. Our aim is therefore to develop learning techniques that can produce models that look more like the models that scientists already write by hand in code. Generating these models efficiently and robustly will require the development of a new class of 
<i>neurosymbolic</i> learning techniques that combine 
the benefits of existing deep learning techniques with recent advances in program synthesis.

In order to drive this research, we have delected four domains where we believe 
these techniques can have significant impact:  
Organic Chemistry, RNA Splicing, Cognitive Science / Behavioral modeling, 
and computing systems.
