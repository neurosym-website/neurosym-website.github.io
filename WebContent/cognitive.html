    <h1>Cognitive and Behavioral science</h1>
    Human conceptual representations have complex and abstract structure allowing us to
    deal efficiently with extremely diverse situations. Concepts are often named by
    single lexical items, providing a convenient window on mental life. For instance,
    take the concepts of 'tree', 'forest', and 'friend'. These are everyday concepts,
    yet they are hard to capture as (even deep) classifiers or other standard machine
    learning approaches. Instead, they are fuzzy, inter-related systems grounded in our
    knowledge of physical things, social agents, and so on.



    <h2>Modeling cognition through programming languages.</h2>
    Functions in a programming language are a good model of human concepts, because
    they admit complex abstraction and model systems of related meanings.
    In particular, programs provide a natural means to capture three key aspects of human concepts: compositional abstraction, graded reasoning under uncertainty, and causal relations.
    Human concept learning can then be viewed as (probabilistic)  program induction. Existing demonstrations of this approach have been hampered by lack of efficient and scalable techniques for program induction.

    We are working to address this by building high-level languages for common sense domains, and using new program learning tools to induce concepts within these domains. The first part of this task amounts to constructing
    a "standard library" for core knowledge and the second part to concept learning by probabilistic program induction. Below are some of our ongoing efforts as part of this thrust.

            Understanding causal reasoning in Autumn.
        </h1>
        Humans are often able to learn detailed causal relationships in the environment from very limited interactions with it.  For example, children can figure out the causal mechanism underlying a new toy or
        video game in just a few minutes, a feat woefully out of reach of modern AI systems.
        As part of this effort, we are studying the construction of causal theories – explanations of which stimuli cause which changes in an environment – using program synthesis.
        By representing a causal model as a program, we take advantage of two key features that standard ML models do not possess: programs' compact, interpretable form and data-efficient learning algorithms.

        We have developed a simple domain to explore this hypothesis, consisting of Atari-style, time-varying grid worlds. We express causal mechanisms in these worlds using a functional reactive programming
        language called <a href="https://github.com/riadas/Autumn.jl">Autumn</a>, which we designed to concisely capture these dynamics. Our objective is to synthesize the underlying Autumn program given a short sequence
        of observed grid frames and user actions.

        We are working on a full conference submission on this work, but an early version was presented at the
        Advances in Programming Languages and Neurosymbolic Systems workshop in NeurIPS '21 and the Causal Inference & Machine Learning workshop, also at NeurIPS<cite>Ria21aiplans</cite>.
        This project is beign led by graduate student <a href="https://riadas.github.io/">Ria Das</a> and former postdoc <a href="http://www.zenna.org/">Zenna Tavares</a>
        in collaboration with Josh Tenenbaum and Armando Solar-Lezama.

    <h2>Understanding behavior.</h2>
    Behavior is arguably the most complex phenotype one could analyze in life and
    cognitive sciences. For instance, what is a concise theory that explains courtship in fruit
    flies?  Such questions are pervasive in the life sciences where fine-grained behavior
    of model organisms (e.g., fruit flies or macaques) are being collected at an
    unprecedented scale.  The study of dynamic behavior such as courtship is an ideal
    testbed for our research agenda.  On the one hand, scientists want to discover
    short programs that provide an interpretable explanation of courtship.
    On the other hand, the raw data is high dimensional in both time and space, and it
    also contains significant variability in the behavior of interest, thus requiring deep
    learning to process raw data and instantiate modules within the program.
