<p>
In most bacteria, the process of protein synthesis involves a transcription step, 
where a strand of messenger RNA is assembled as a copy of a gene with 
the help of RNA polymerase, followed by 
a translation step, where Rybosomes decode the gene into a sequence of aminoacids 
that will fold into a protein. 

Back in the 1970s, however, co-PI Phillip Sharp and his team discovered that in 
eucaryotes, transcription also involves <i>splicing</i>, where a complex of 
molecules 
called the <i>spliceosome</i> would bind to the RNA to remove segments of 
non-coding RNA known as <i>introns</i>, leaving behind the expressed portions 
of the RNA strand known as <i>exons</i>.    
</p>

<p>
In the years since that discovery, biology has learned a great amount about the 
mechanisms involved in RNA splicing and the myriad of RNA-binding proteins 
that regulate the action of the splyceosome. However, we are still far from a
comprehensive model that would help us predict with certainty the effect that
different intervations---whether mutations or the addition of small molecules---  
will have on how a given RNA sequence will be spliced.   
</p>

<i><a href="splicingPrimer.html">[Check out our quick primer to learn more about splicing.]</a></i>

<p>
Developing better models of splicing is critical to understanding 
a myriad of diseases. For example, many genetic diseases including 
early onset Parkinson disease, spinal muscular atrophy and 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis can all be traced back to mutations 
that alter splicing. Splicing errors are also behind many forms of 
cancer.  
</p>

<p>
Deep learning has already demonstrated some promise in turning the large amounts
of data available about how particular genes are spliced into predictions
about the effect of certain mutations on RNA splicing. However, the neurosymbolic 
learning techniques that we plan to develop as part of this proposal could allow us 
to develop richer models that capture more of what is known about the splicing process 
and the molecules involved. This could help us move beyond simply making predictions,
to a real understanding of <i>why</i> particular mutations have the effects that they 
have.
