<h1>Organic Chemistry</h1>

One of the seminal problems in organic chemistry is to be able to engineer 
molecules with particularly desirable properties, or at the very least to 
predict the properties that a particular molecule is going to have. 

In recent years, deep learning has been making tremendous strides in both
of these problems. Modern techniques developed by the team of co-PIs 
Barzilay and Jaakkola have demonstrated remarkable abilities in both property 
prediction and molecular optimization. However, deep learning approaches also 
have some important limitations: First, they are extremely data intensive, limiting
their application to domains where very large amounts of data are available. 
Second, they operate as a black box; from a scientific standpoint, we would like 
to abstract specific substructures or functional group descriptions that caused a particular molecule to screen high
on the desired property. 

The promise of neurosymbolic models is that they will be able to 
better incorporate expert knowledge. Models that are better able to incorporate
expert knowledge would be useful in settings where data is difficult to gather.
