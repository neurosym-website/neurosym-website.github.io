	<h1>Programmatic Reinforcement Learning</h1>
	
	We study reinforcement learning algorithms that generate policies that can be represented in expressive high-level Domain Specific Languages (DSL). This work aims to simultaneously address four fundamental drawbacks of Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep-RL), where the policy is represented by a neural network; interpretability, verifiability, reliability and domain awareness. We formalize a new learning paradigm and provide empirical and theoretical evidence to show that we can generate policies in expressive DSLs that do not suffer from the above shortcomings of Deep-RL. To overcome the challenges of policy search in non-differentiable program space, we introduce a meta-algorithm that is based on mirror descent, program synthesis, and imitation learning. This approach leverages neurosymbolic learning, using synthesized symbolic programs to regularize Deep-RL and using the gradients available to Deep-RL to improve the quality of synthesized programs. Overall this approach establishes a synergistic relationship between Deep-RL and program synthesis.

9/2020: Neurosym webinar series.

In the first talk in the series, Kevin Ellis&mdash;research scientist at Common Sense Machines, and soon to be faculty member at 
the Computer Science Department at Cornell&mdash;will talk about his recent work on growing domain specific languages.

<h1>Growing domain-specific languages alongside neural program synthesizers via wake-sleep program learning</h1>

Two challenges in engineering program synthesis systems are: (1) crafting specialized yet expressive domain specific languages, and (2) designing search algorithms that can tractably explore the space of expressions in this domain specific language. We take a step toward the joint learning of domain specific languages, and the search algorithms that perform synthesis in that language. We propose an algorithm which starts with a relatively minimal domain specific language, and then enriches that language by compressing out common syntactic patterns into a library of reusable domain specific code. In tandem, the system trains a neural network to guide search over expressions in the growing language. From a machine learning perspective, this system implements a wake-sleep algorithm similar to the Helmholtz machine. We apply this algorithm to AI and program synthesis problems, with the goal of understanding how domain specific languages and neural program synthesizers can mutually bootstrap one another.
