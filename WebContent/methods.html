<h1>Machine learning meets programs synthesis</h1>

<p>
<slide>
Main:Slide25
</slide>
Our goal is to build a meta-framework that can be used to synthesize 
programs to predict and understand data in a range of scientific domains. 
In particular, this framework will synthesize <i>neurosymbolic</i> programs 
that combine both neural and program-like logical components.

For example, the figure illustrates a few examples of the kinds of compositions 
of neural and logical components that our meta-framework will handle. 
We plan to explore neurosymbolic models that go beyond these specific examples 
and interleave neural and symbolic modules following complex hierarchical or 
sequential architectures. Developing a <i>framework</i> that facilitates 
the expression of such rich compositions --- an equivalent of Pytorch or Tensorflow 
for neurosymbolic programming, if you will --- is a central goal of this project. 
</p>

<p>

More broadly, a major goal for the project is to develop a <i>science</i> of 
neurosymbolic learning. 
This will include developing new algorithms 
that specifically address the challenges in the neurosymbolic setting---e.g. 
how to design good domain specific languages (DSLs) to support the symbolic 
part of a model, the presence of uncertainty, the need to perform continuous 
optimization over the neural network parameters in conjunction with discrete 
optimization over the program structure, and the need to actively design 
experiments to disambiguate between candidate hypotheses/programs.

It will also include developing an understanding of when to deploy different 
algorithms, as well as which combinations of neural and symbolic components work 
better for which settings. 

Our proposed framework will serve as a platform for exploring these algorithms 
and deploying them in each of our problem domains.
