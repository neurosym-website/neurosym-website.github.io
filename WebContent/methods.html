<h1>Machine learning meets programs synthesis</h1>

<p>
<slide>
Main:Slide25
</slide>
Our goal is to build a meta-framework that can be used to synthesize 
programs to predict and understand data in a range of scientific domains. 
In particular, this framework will synthesize <i>neurosymbolic</i> programs 
that combine both neural and program-like logical components.

For example, the figure illustrates a few examples of the kinds of compositions 
of neural and logical components that our meta-framework will handle. 
We plan to explore neurosymbolic models that go beyond these specific examples 
and interleave neural and symbolic modules following complex hierarchical or 
sequential architectures. Developing a <i>framework</i> that facilitates 
the expression of such rich compositions --- an equivalent of Pytorch or Tensorflow 
for neurosymbolic programming, if you will --- is a central goal of this project. 
</p>

<p>

More broadly, a major goal for the project is to develop a <i>science</i> of 
neurosymbolic learning. 
This will include developing new algorithms 
that specifically address the challenges in the neurosymbolic setting---e.g. 
how to design good domain specific languages (DSLs) to support the symbolic 
part of a model, the presence of uncertainty, the need to perform continuous 
optimization over the neural network parameters in conjunction with discrete 
optimization over the program structure, and the need to actively design 
experiments to disambiguate between candidate hypotheses/programs.

It will also include developing an understanding of when to deploy different 
algorithms, as well as which combinations of neural and symbolic components work 
better for which settings. 

Our proposed framework will serve as a platform for exploring these algorithms 
and deploying them in each of our problem domains.

    <h1>A science of Neurosymbolic Programming</h1>

    There is a growing body of work exploring different ways to combine the benefits of deep learning with the benefits of
    hand-written programs. In a recent collaborative effort between co-PIs Swarat Chaudhuri, Yisong Yue and Armando Solar-Lezama with project
    alumni Kevin Ellis and collaborators Oleksandr Polozov and Rishabh Singh, we have sought to organize existing work into a conceptual 
    framework that can help us understand the different ways in which neural learning and program synthesis can come together to achieve a variety 
    of goals ranging from interpretability, to sample efficiency to correctness and consistency with prior knowledge. 
    The paper was published in 2021 as part of the Foundations and Trends in Programming Languages series<cite>ChaudhuriEPSSY21</cite>.

<div class="project">
    <h1>Learning Domain Specific Languages</h1>
    The goal of this effort is to use neurosymbolic techniques to automatically learn a domain specific language (DSL) from a corpus of problems from a given domain. This is an important problem because it 
    addresses one of the fundamental limitations of neurosymbolic programming: the need to have an expert design a domain specific language to make program synthesis tractable. 

    In a first paper published in PLDI 2020, we showed that it is possible to automatically discover DSLs for a variety of problems including the problem of automatically discovering physics equations. For example, 
    in one experiment, our system (DreamCoder) is given data from equations describing 60 different physical laws and mathematical identities taken from AP and MCAT physics “cheat sheets”. The system is initialized 
    with a small number of sequence manipulation primitives like map and fold and after 8 iterations of the algorithm it is able to discover 93% of the laws and identities in the dataset by first learning the building 
    blocks of vector algebra and then learning constructs common to many of the formulas such as inverse square laws. The paper was published in PLDI 2020 <cite>EllisWNSMHCST21</cite>.

    <h1>
        Synthesis of Reactive Programs with Structured Latent State
    </h1>
    In the context of the <a href="cognitive.html#autumn">Autumn effort</a>,
    we developed a new synthesis algorithm that combines automata based synthesis with functional synthesis.
    This algorithm allows us to synthesize fairly large functional reactive programs from observations of sequences of frames in an Autumn game.
    We are working on a full conference submission on this work, but an early version was presented at the 
     Advances in Programming Languages and Neurosymbolic Systems workshop in NeurIPS '21 and the Causal Inference & Machine Learning workshop, also at NeurIPS<cite>Ria21aiplans</cite>.
