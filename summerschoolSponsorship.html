    <h1>Summer school on Neurosymbolic Programming July 11-13 2022</h1>
    <p>
        <B>Sponsorship opportunities</B>
        We are seeking sponsors to help make the <a href="summerschool.html">The summer school </a> a success and to help ensure that a broad cross section of students 
        can attend and benefit from the experience regardless of their funding situation. 
        Our target for the summer school is to have 80 participants, although as of April 30, we already had 117 applicants with 73% being graduate students and 11.4% being 
        undergraduates, the rest being academic and industrial researchers. 42% of our applicants so far have expressed that they would only be able to attend if they 
        receive some financial aid. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Specifically, we are asking companies to sponsor travel grants for students.
        The cost of sponsoring each student would be <b>$960</b>. For each student that the company sponsors,
        the student will receive a travel grant that will reimburse them for their airfare and hotel for the three days
        of the event. The grant rate per student was calculated based on our quoted hotel costs (assuming 2 students per room)
        and on the airfare rates from different cities to LA as of the end of April. Any funds left over after funding the
        travel grants will be used to help cover some of the costs associated with running the event (mainly food).
    </p>
    <p>
        Every student funded by a travel grant from the company will receive an e-mail that will include an acknowledgement
        that the sponsoring company will be able to customize. Sponsoring companies will be included in the event website and
        will be acknowledged during the opening presentation every day of the summer school.        
        Additional benefits will depend on the number of students sponsored by a company as detailed below.
