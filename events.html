	<h1>From word models to world models: Translating from natural language to the probabilistic language of
		thought</h1>

	<p><i>Read on April 3, 2023</i></p>

	Gabe Grand gave a presentation on an upcoming position paper on the topic of solving reasoning tasks by
	having a model learn to translate from natural language to the probabilistic language of thought.
	Specifically, an LLM is prompted with a world model and then used to translate conditions, queries,
	and even new definitions into Church statements, allowing the use of sampling procedures to infer
	the answers to queries. This approach outperforms LLMs trying to directly reason without the use
	of the symbolic component.

				<h1>AI for Scientists: Accelerating Discovery through Knowledge, Data & Learning</h1>
 
				Scientific discoveries have created solutions to global problems and fundamentally improved our world. 
				With rapidly increasing amounts of experimental data, machine learning becomes more and more crucial for automating scientific data analysis. 
				However, many real-world workflows demand expert-in-the-loop attention and require models that not only interface with data, but also with experts such as behavioral neuroscientists and medical doctors. 
				My research centers around scientist-in-the-loop frameworks that bridge machine learning and real-world use cases, to enable scalable interpretation of scientific insight from data. 
				These models must accommodate vastly varying data, analysis tasks, and existing knowledge inherent in scientific domains, while optimizing expert effort in the workflow. 
				My approach is to understand the interface between data, models, and scientists across domains, and apply this understanding to develop more efficient methods, such as for discovering semantically meaningful structure from data and integrating domain knowledge with learning. 
				I collaborate closely with scientists to integrate these methods in practice to accelerate scientific progress.

				<B>Bio:</B>  Jennifer is a PhD candidate in Computing and Mathematical Sciences at Caltech, advised by Professors Pietro Perona and Yisong Yue. 
				Her research focuses on developing computational systems for scientists, especially in workflows that require expert-in-the-loop interactions, such as for studying behavioral, affective, or medical data. 
				She aims to accelerate AI-assisted scientific discovery and optimize expert attention in real-world workflows, addressing bottlenecks including data annotation efficiency, model interpretability and generalization, and semantic structure discovery.

<div class="talk_box">
<h1>From Probabilistic Logics to Neuro-Symbolic Artificial Intelligence</h1>

Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive ability in writing code. In this talk, I will present some of our works on further improving their programming ability using neurosymbolic techniques. In particular, I will talk about how we can use program execution to (i) augment the training by learning from semantically equivalent programs: a key insight here is that learning can also benefit from partially correct programs that we can identify using program tracing and (ii) filter the generated code at inference time using a fault-aware neural code ranker model: a key insight here is that a model trained to predict how a code fails (rather than just predicting if a code fails) can have a better understanding of the code and the task. We use the above methods on multiple LLMs such as Codex, GPT-J and GPT-Neo models and we show better performance on multiple coding/math reasoning datasets.

Pietro Perona &mdash; leader of the Computation and Neural Systems program at the California Institute of Technology &mdash; will be talking about emergence of number sense.
<div class="talk_box">
<h1>A sense for number and quantity as an emergent property of a manipulating agent</h1>

The ability to understand and manipulate numbers and quantities emerges during childhood, but the mechanism through which this ability is developed is still poorly understood. In particular, it is not known whether acquiring such a number sense is possible without supervision from a teacher.
<br/>
<br/>
To explore this question, we propose a model in which spontaneous and undirected manipulation of small objects trains perception to predict the resulting scene changes. We find that, from this task, a representation emerges that supports understanding numbers and quantity. Emergent properties include distinct categories for zero and the first few natural numbers, a notion of order, and a signal that correlates with numerical quantity. As a result, our model acquires the ability to estimate the number of objects in the scene, as well as subitization, i.e. the ability to recognize at a glance the exact number of objects in small scenes. We conclude that important aspects of a facility with numbers and quantities may be learned without explicit teacher supervision.

Luc De Raedt &mdash; professor at the Department of Computer Science, KU Leuven, and director of Leuven.AI &mdash; will be talking about probabilistic logics for neurosymbolic AI.
	
<div class="talk_box">
<h1>From Probabilistic Logics to Neuro-Symbolic Artificial Intelligence</h1>

A central challenge to contemporary AI is to integrate learning and reasoning. The integration of learning and reasoning has been studied for decades already in the fields of statistical relational artificial intelligence and probabilistic programming. StarAI has focussed on unifying logic and probability, the two key frameworks for reasoning, and has extended this probabilistic logics machine learning principles. I will argue that StarAI and Probabilistic Logics form an ideal basis for developing neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence techniques. Thus neuro-symbolic computation = StarAI + Neural Networks. Many parallels will be drawn between these two fields and will be illustrated using the Deep Probabilistic Logic Programming language DeepProbLog.

Yu Feng &mdash; Assistant Professor at UC Santa Barbara &mdash; will be talking about machine learning smart contract verification.
	
<div class="talk_box">
<h1>Hardening Solidity Smart Contracts with Refinement Types, for Free</h1>
	
As smart contracts gain adoption in financial transactions, it becomes increasingly important to ensure that they are free of bugs and security vulnerabilities. We present SolType, a refinement type system for Solidity that can be used to prevent arithmetic over- and under-flows in smart contracts. SolType allows developers to add refinement type annotations and uses them to prove the safety of arithmetic operations. Specifically, SolType incorporates a rich vocabulary of refinement terms that allow expressing relationships between integer values and aggregate properties of complex data structures. To reduce manual annotations, SolType also incorporates a type inference engine using CHC solvers and can automatically infer non-trivial contract invariants.
<br/>
<br/>
Even with the type inference engine, there are still many cases in which we can not infer the invariants, which is a fundamental problem in smart contract verification. Inspired by how human experts construct contract invariants, we propose Venti, the first learning framework for contract invariants. We show how to formulate learning contract invariants as a Markov decision process (MDP) and use reinforcement learning to synthesize the invariants for the underlying MDP. By training with reinforcement learning, Venti captures rich program features and avoids the need for ground truth solutions as supervision. Compared to previous learning tasks for invariant generation, it addresses unique challenges, such as a compact graph representation that dramatically reduces the size of the smart contract while preserving its core semantics.

Xinyun Chen &mdash; Ph.D. candidate at UC Berkeley &mdash; will be talking about neural program synthesis.
	
<div class="talk_box">
<h1>Neural Program Synthesis for Language Understanding in the Wild</h1>
	
Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing, especially with the advancement of pre-training techniques. Moreover, recent works show that by training on a large-scale code corpus, sometimes these language models could even generate moderately complicated code from text descriptions, including Tabnine and Codex. In this talk, I will discuss my research on deep learning for program synthesis with two central goals: (1) developing program synthesizers that learn to infer the user intents for real-world deployment; and (2) improving the reasoning and generalization capabilities of existing language models via symbolic representations.
<br/>
<br/>
First, I will discuss my SpreadsheetCoder work, where we aim to predict spreadsheet formulas only from the user-written tabular data, without the requirements of any explicit specifications. The SpreadsheetCoder model was recently integrated into Google Sheets, and could potentially benefit hundreds of millions of users. In the second part of my talk, I will go beyond program synthesis applications, and discuss my work on neural-symbolic techniques for language understanding. Despite the tremendous achievements of pre-trained language models, large-scale training does not automatically result in the capability of complex reasoning beyond text pattern matching. By integrating a symbolic reasoning module that synthesizes and executes programs for the task of interest, our neural-symbolic models demonstrate superior compositional reasoning ability, including numerical reasoning and compositional generalization.

Petar Veličković &mdash; Senior Research Scientist at DeepMind &mdash; will be talking about neural algorithmic reasoning. 	

<div class="talk_box">
<h1>Neuralising a Computer Scientist: The Story So Far</h1>

Neural networks that are able to reliably execute algorithmic computation may hold transformative potential to both machine learning and theoretical computer science. On one hand, they could enable the kind of extrapolative generalisation scarcely seen with deep learning models. On another, they may allow for running classical algorithms on inputs previously considered inaccessible to them.
<br/>
<br/>
Both of these promises are shepherded by the neural algorithmic reasoning blueprint, which I have recently proposed in a position paper alongside Charles Blundell. On paper, this is a remarkably elegant pipeline for reasoning on natural inputs which carefully leverages the tried-and-tested power of deep neural networks as feature extractors. In practice, how far did we actually take it?
<br/>
<br/>
In this talk, I will present three concrete steps we've recently taken towards viably deploying the blueprint at scale:
<br/>
    A dataset of algorithmic reasoning tasks, to be used as a bootstrapping basis; <br/>
    Using algorithmic reasoners to positively modulate self-supervised representations; <br/>
    Data-efficient implicit planning using algorithmic reasoners. <br/>
<br/>
along with some thoughts on where we could go next.
<p/>
<B>Bio:</B> Petar Veličković is a Senior Research Scientist at DeepMind. He holds a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Cambridge (Trinity College), obtained under the supervision of Pietro Liò. His research concerns geometric deep learning—devising neural network architectures that respect the invariances and symmetries in data (a topic he's co-written a proto-book about). Within this area, Petar focuses on graph representation learning and its applications in algorithmic reasoning and computational biology. He has published relevant research in these areas at both machine learning venues (NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML-W) and biomedical venues and journals (Bioinformatics, PLOS One, JCB, PervasiveHealth).

<div class="talk_box">
<h1>Towards Reliable and Robust Model Explanations</h1>

As machine learning black boxes are increasingly being deployed in domains such as healthcare and criminal justice, there is growing emphasis on building tools and techniques for explaining these black boxes in an interpretable manner. Such explanations are being leveraged by domain experts to diagnose systematic errors and underlying biases of black boxes. In this talk, I will present some of our recent research that sheds light on the vulnerabilities of popular post hoc explanation techniques such as LIME and SHAP, and also introduce novel methods to address some of these vulnerabilities. More specifically, I will first demonstrate that these methods are brittle, unstable, and are vulnerable to a variety of adversarial attacks. Then, I will discuss two solutions to address some of the aforementioned vulnerabilities–(i) a Bayesian framework that captures the uncertainty associated with post hoc explanations and in turn allows us to generate explanations with user specified levels of confidence, and (ii) a framework based on adversarial training that is designed to make post hoc explanations more stable and robust to shifts in the underlying data; I will conclude the talk by discussing our recent theoretical results which shed light on the equivalence and robustness of state-of-the-art explanation methods.

Percy Liang &mdash; Associate Professor of Computer Science at Stanford University &mdash; will be talking about machine learning for program repair. 			
	  
<div class="talk_box">
<h1>Learning to Fix Programs</h1>

A huge amount of time is spent by programmers fixing broken code.  Our goal is to train neural models that can do this automatically.  I will first present DrRepair, a system that learns to edit programs based on error messages.  We leverage a large number of valid programs by artificially perturbing (and thus breaking) them.  DrRepair obtains strong results on two tasks: fixing errors made by students and pseudocode-to-code translation.  We then present a new framework, Break-It-Fix-It (BIFI), which additionally leverages unlabeled broken code to learn a model that perturbs code to generate more realistic broken code.  We show that this results in further improvements over DrRepair.  Taken together, our work suggests that one can learn a lot just from unlabeled programs and a compiler and no further manual annotations.<p/>

<div class="talk_box">
<h1>Implicit Symbolic Representation and Reasoning in Deep Neural Networks</h1>
		
Standard neural network architectures can *in principle* implement symbol processing operations like logical deduction and simulation of complex automata. But do current neural models, trained on standard tasks like image recognition and language understanding, learn to perform symbol manipulation *in practice*? I'll survey two recent findings about implicit symbolic behavior in deep networks. First, I will describe a procedure for automatically labeling neurons with compositional logical descriptions of their behavior. These descriptions surface interpretable learned abstractions in models for vision and language, reveal implicit logical "definitions" of visual and linguistic categories, and enable the design of simple adversarial attacks that exploit errors in definitions. Second, I'll describe ongoing work showing that neural models for language generation perform implicit simulation of entities and relations described by text. Representations in these language models can be (linearly) translated into logical representations of world state, and can be directly edited to produce predictable changes in generated output. Together, these results suggest that highly structured representations and behaviors can emerge even in relatively unstructured models trained on natural tasks. Symbolic models of computation can play a key role in helping us understand these models.

<div class="talk_box">
<h1>Scallop: End-to-end Differentiable Reasoning at Scale</h1>
		
Approaches to systematically combine symbolic reasoning with deep learning have demonstrated remarkable promise in terms of accuracy and generalizability.  However, the complexity of exact probabilistic reasoning renders these methods inefficient for real-world, data-intensive machine learning applications.  I will present Scallop, a scalable differentiable probabilistic Datalog engine equipped with a top-k approximate inference algorithm.  The algorithm significantly reduces the amount of computation needed for inference and learning tasks without affecting their principal outcomes.  To evaluate Scallop, we have crafted a challenging dataset, VQAR, comprising 4 million Visual Question Answering (VQA) instances that necessitate reasoning about real-world images with external common-sense knowledge.  Scallop not only scales to these instances but also outperforms state-of-the-art neural-based approaches by 12.44%.

<div class="talk_box">
<h1>Understanding the Visual World Through Code</h1>
		
Much of our visual world is highly regular: objects are often symmetric and have repetitive parts; indoor scenes such as corridors often consist of objects organized in a repetitive layout. How can we infer and represent such regular structures from raw visual data, and later exploit them for better scene recognition, synthesis, and editing? In this talk, I will present our recent work on developing neuro-symbolic methods for scene understanding. Here, symbolic programs and neural nets play complementary roles: symbolic programs are more data-efficient to train and generalize better to new scenarios, as they robustly capture high-level structure; deep nets effectively extract complex, low-level patterns from cluttered visual data. I will demonstrate the power of such hybrid models in three different domains: 2D image editing, 3D shape modeling, and human motion understanding.

<div class="talk_box">
<h1>A Glance into Machine Programming @ Intel Labs</h1>
	
As defined by "The Three Pillars of Machine Programming", machine programming (MP) is concerned with the automation of software development. The three pillars partition MP into the following conceptual components: (i) intention, (ii) invention, and (iii) adaptation, with data being a foundational element that is generally necessary for all pillars. While the goal of MP is complete software automation – something that is likely decades away – we believe there are many seminal research opportunities waiting to be explored today across the three pillars. </br>

In this talk, we will provide a glance into the new Pioneering Machine Programming Research effort at Intel Labs and how it has been established around the three pillars across the entire company. We will also discuss Intel Labs’ general charter for MP, as well as a few early research systems that we have built and are using today to improve the quality and rate at which we are developing software (and hardware) in production systems

<div class="talk_box">
<h1>Programmatic Reinforcement Learning</h1>
	
We study reinforcement learning algorithms that generate policies that can be represented in expressive high-level Domain Specific Languages (DSL). This work aims to simultaneously address four fundamental drawbacks of Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep-RL), where the policy is represented by a neural network; interpretability, verifiability, reliability and domain awareness. We formalize a new learning paradigm and provide empirical and theoretical evidence to show that we can generate policies in expressive DSLs that do not suffer from the above shortcomings of Deep-RL. To overcome the challenges of policy search in non-differentiable program space, we introduce a meta-algorithm that is based on mirror descent, program synthesis, and imitation learning. This approach leverages neurosymbolic learning, using synthesized symbolic programs to regularize Deep-RL and using the gradients available to Deep-RL to improve the quality of synthesized programs. Overall this approach establishes a synergistic relationship between Deep-RL and program synthesis.

the Computer Science Department at Cornell &mdash; will talk about his recent work on growing domain specific languages. 
	

<div class="talk_box">
<h1>Growing domain-specific languages alongside neural program synthesizers via wake-sleep program learning</h1>

Two challenges in engineering program synthesis systems are: (1) crafting specialized yet expressive domain specific languages, and (2) designing search algorithms that can tractably explore the space of expressions in this domain specific language. We take a step toward the joint learning of domain specific languages, and the search algorithms that perform synthesis in that language. We propose an algorithm which starts with a relatively minimal domain specific language, and then enriches that language by compressing out common syntactic patterns into a library of reusable domain specific code. In tandem, the system trains a neural network to guide search over expressions in the growing language. From a machine learning perspective, this system implements a wake-sleep algorithm similar to the Helmholtz machine. We apply this algorithm to AI and program synthesis problems, with the goal of understanding how domain specific languages and neural program synthesizers can mutually bootstrap one another.
